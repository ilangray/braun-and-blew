Attempt 1:
	picked 7 colors at extreme of RGB scale. would have picked 8, but we couldnt come up with a last one.
	
	turns out that the 6th color (orangy) is too close to the red, but other than that this attempt is 
	an improvement over teh rainbow (larger distances when eyeballed from about 2 feet away)

Attempt 2:
	changed color[6] from orange to gray, and color[7] to black.

	looks like distances improved, as gray is not similar to red, and black is relatively far from 
	everything else.

	however, yellow (5) + green (3) are a bit too close for comfort. gray and black are also similar

Attempt 3:
	changed pinkish/purpley to a darker pink, which is really close to red, but resulted in a higher average
	and lower SD overall, so that sounds like a win.

	problems: blue and yellow are similar to each other, but they are both extremely far from blue, so trade offs.
	would we rather trade some of their distances from blue for some distance between them?

Attempt 4:
	changed: darkened yellow

	resulted in lower stdev, but also a lower average. Not sure if worth it.

Attempt 5:
	changed: blue --> purply blue

	resulted in lower avg (BAD) and lower stdev (WIN!). Net effect? Hard to tell the difference between the two colors schemes. New one looks slightly more asthetically pleasing.
